              The New Model
            </div>
            <div className="poppins-regular pt-2">
              In this article, I present a holistic business model in which
              culture plays a central role in driving growth and success. This
              model transcends the superficial discussions on culture often
              heard in leadership meetings and goes beyond token gestures like
              employee satisfaction surveys and recognitions. Instead, they
              should embrace culture as the very core of their business, not a
              peripheral concern relegated to HR.
            </div>
            <div className="poppins-regular pt-3">
              A great culture doesn't necessarily mean keeping employees
              comfortable and happy. Not all successful cultures include
              comfortable employees, but they do include proud participants. A
              truly successful culture unites the firm's goals, resources, and
              strategies into a comprehensive and formidable system. As such,
              culture is a unified set of beliefs and behaviours that
              harmoniously drive toward business objectives.

          <div className="poppins-regular pt-2 pb-3">
            Today's most successful companies proudly exhibit distinctive
            cultures. Consider Amazon, Google, Bumble, Godrej, Southwest,
            Netflix, Infosys, and Mu Sigma â€” each has a unique and strong
            cultural identity. Culture transforms work groups into teams and
            goals into results. A study by James L. Heskett and John P. Kotter
            found that companies with strong corporate cultures that aligned
            with their business objectives achieved revenue growth of 682
            percent, employment growth of 282 percent, stock price growth of 901
            percent, and net income growth of 756 percent over eleven years. My
            proposed holistic business model, called C-PLOS (Comprehensive
            Professional Leadership Operating System), is a conceptual path
            analysis of how things happen in business. For example, it includes
            over 50 strategic moves a leader can deploy to control business
            outcomes better. However, any detailed discussions are beyond this
            article's scope. The key point, nevertheless, is that it is
            important to recognise that strategy, staffing, execution, systems,
            and innovation can all fail within a poor culture.
